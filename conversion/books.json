A company trade card issued in 1892, in time for the Chicago World Fair, claimed that for twenty years in India Singer had “been a factor in helping the people of India toward a better civilization.","As entrepreneurs and technological intermediaries between Europeans and the mass of the population, Parsis occupied a crucial role in the dissemination and popularization of everyday technology in India","Patell’s “race” was used against him and the business methods he employed to sell sewing machines","By virtue of their mixed racial origins and Western lifestyles, Eurasians were assumed to be more European than Indian in their aptitude for European technology while also having the advantage of (some) familiarity with Indian languages and customs","For him selling sewing machines in India was essentially about selling them to men, particularly to men who by custom and trade were tailors","women were urged to take up useful domestic tasks like sewing and to cut costs or augment family incomes by making their own clothes.","Sewing and embroidery were similarly disciplinary tasks imposed upon young women in “criminal settlements” located in mainland India","Like bicycles, and later radios, motor scooters, and automobiles, sewing machines became highly prized dowry presents, given by the bride’s family to the groom’s.","Rather like the Japanese housewives whom Robin LeBlanc characterizes as “bicycle citizens,” for many Europeans riding a bicycle became a means of identifying themselves as being on the margins of the white elite.38 Cycling in the heat of the Indian day, a European was likely to arrive at his or her destination sweaty and disheveled, his or her racial authority compromised. A horse, a motorcycle, better still an automobile, was a more dignifed proposition and preserved greater social distance between colonizer and colonized.","Daphne Manners, a volunteer nurse, also rides a bicycle and uses it to meet her Indian lover Hari Kumar. Their bicycles become a symbol of racial and sexual transgression","A young Parsi, Scouter Davar, set oﬀ in January 1924 on a solo journey to “encircle the world” that lasted seven years. Having covered sixty-fve thousand miles, crossed the Sahara, penetrated African jungles, and scaled Andean passes, he returned home to a hero’s welcome.","while for young men the bicycle might be a means to adventure (including visits to cinemas and brothels), for women the bicycle symbolized the constraints patriarchy imposed on their adult lives.","It was partly from among traditional “service communities,” such as Brahmins and Kayasthas, that the clerks, typists, and stenographers of the modern government and business ofce were recruited.","These were individuals whose literacy and high-caste status appeared barely rewarded by the tedium of their working lives, the paltry nature of their salaries, and the racial abuse they received in government ofces and merchant houses around the city. As","Remington, which established its own schools in India to “train the Babu or educated native in the ‘twin arts’ [of typing and stenography],” produced the majority of typists entering government service.","In his South African law practice Gandhi employed two European female secretaries, though subsequently, on his return to India in 1915, he decided that it was unnatural for Indian women, life’s nurturers and carers, to earn their living working outside the home as typists and receptionists.59","In 1881 the central branch of the YWCA in New York began teaching typing as a suitable occupation for young, single women. Twenty years later the Calcutta YWCA followed suit, oﬀering typing lessons for women and these rapidly became popular","The Calcutta YWCA was clear about its feminist agenda. Typing and secretarial work was a means of giving women a decent occupation: it helped make them self-sufcient and gave them “the gift of power in their lives.” The YWCA also targeted a specifc kind of female constituency—Europeans from “home” (Britain), “domiciled” (India-born and India-educated) Britons, Eurasians, and Indian Christians","One of the most successful of all swadeshi enterprises was the production and sale of Ayurvedic medicines, a primary feature of Hindu cultural revivalism but also a signifcant avenue for emerging Indian commerce and consumerism","Nor was swadeshi an exclusively nationalist ploy. Once the idea had gained popularity, even American cigarette frms and British soap makers began to establish their own factories in India","While discussion of swadeshi has mainly focused on Bengal, the role of Punjab, a thousand miles to the northwest, was also highly signifcant.","Bishandas Basil, the engineer who developed the frst Indian-made sewing machine (the “Usha”), worked in Calcutta but was originally from Ludhiana in Punjab.","With its blend of novelty and excitement, of desire and display, the bazaar represented a site of cultural exchange as well as commercial transaction.","despite the passing of colonial rule, many of the technological constraints on Indian production remained, and local frms found it necessary to seek foreign collaborators, including British manufacturers","even before the end of World War I, Remington was producing typewriters adapted for the use of the Urdu, Marathi, Gujarati, and Bengali scripts.","A “craze” for the modern was constrained not only by endemic poverty, by foreign monopolies, and by patriotic concerns but also by a critique of the machine as soulless, impersonal, and foreign.","It is possible to fnd Indian writers, from R. K. Narayan to Ruskin Bond,38 for whom the acquisition of a typewriter marked a crucial stage in the development of their literary career, but many writers, working especially in the vernaculars, seem to have preferred writing by hand, leaving the typewriter to the humdrum clerk.","In keeping with the imperial need for grand “state works,” under colonialism, India’s engineering expertise mainly lay in large-scale projects, such as bridge building and railroad construction. This had not been matched by the precision engineering required to make small but complex items of machinery","Just as the prototype Indian sewing machine, the “Usha,” took a recent German machine (the Pfaﬀ) as its model, so the frst Godrej machine was based on an American “Woodstock” typewriter","Among the most popular of these machines was the “Bihia mill” made by a British frm, Thomson and Mylne, in Bihar","The introduction of Indian machines, their design pragmatically pirated from American Engelberg hullers, signifcantly reduced purchase costs and facilitated the spread of rural rice milling","Milled rice exemplifed the modern. Attempts to revive the production and sale of hand-husked rice on patriotic or nutritional grounds in the 1930s met with scant success","The promotion of health and cleanliness, the prevention or treatment of disease, were among themes commonly used in advertising, often trading on Indian ideas of purity and propriety, such as the sale of soaps free from animal fat","Selling goods by proclaiming their pleasurable eﬀects or health benefts was a common advertising ploy and not one confned to machines alone. “Passing Show” cigarettes were sold in India promising “joy in every puﬀ.” “Protect your health,” ran one advertisement. “If you value your health you should certainly smoke Passing Show","Part Western, part homegrown, the social idealism of the sanitized factory, operated by healthy workers, immune to labor unrest, and set in a park-like environment became powerfully established in India between the 1930s and 1960s, at precisely the time when industrial capitalism was threatened by increased worker militancy","Godrej took the connection between health and technology seriously, and not just in pursuit of worker satisfaction (there were no strikes at Vikhroli until 1972) and the rewards of industrial paternalism","At the height of the swadeshi movement in 1906, Aurobindo Ghosh likened the inﬂuence of the West to the spread of tuberculosis and called upon Indians to spurn “like deadly poison all those misnamed ideals so dear to the West”— industrialism, consumerism, and imperialism.36 Modernity, thus construed, was the very antithesis of health.","renunciation had perished in the “frenzied race for wealth and luxury.” Although","Although in Bose’s view India was not the only country aﬀected (“the whole world” had become a “scene of destitution, disease, vice and malevolence”), Hindus faced extinction “at no distant date” if they persisted in being the “imbecile imitators” of an “immature civilization.”","In a pattern common to many other parts of the world where men with machines replaced women in food processing, in India this included the usurping of female labor in husking and cleaning rice and in grinding wheat and pulses","the train was a cogent symbol of technological modernity, the dhenki was a potent icon of domestic tradition.","growing body of medical evidence that linked mechanized milling with the spread of the nutrition-defciency disease beriberi","pioneering investigations, frst by Robert McCarrison of the Indian Medical Service and then by W. R. Aykroyd, McCarrison’s successor at the Nutrition Research Laboratories at Coonoor in south India, demonstrated the nutritional poverty of rice compared to other food grains like wheat and millet and used beriberi to illustrate the wider problem of endemic malnutrition in India.","Men were more likely than women to argue that the physical toil of rice pounding was good for women’s health. Equating women’s work with hard labor and urging the benefts of traditional technology has often been a way of denying women the advantages","The experience of everyday technology for those who worked with machines or came into daily contact with them was strikingly diﬀerent from the images of health with which this chapter began","Loose” clothing (such as dhotis, saris, turbans, and shawls) was caught in whirling machines, dragging workers to their deaths; women’s hair was trapped in conveyor belts and ﬂywheels; internal walls and grain stores collapsed, killing “coolies” or causing broken ribs and fractured limbs; men, women, and juvenile workers carrying heavy loads of grain tripped and fell into vats of boiling rice","Motilal Nehru, a leading Allahabad lawyer and father of Jawaharlal Nehru, was famously the frst Indian to own an automobile in the city in 1907","just as the ofcial fles of the period abound with requests for automobile purchases and allowances, so are they replete with orders for typewriters or for their replacement and repair","Cycles were supplied to units of both the British and Indian armies, and Indian troops equipped with bicycles fought in World War I, as at the Battle of the Somme","Just as workers in rice mills were held responsible for the accidents that befell them, so were cyclists and pedestrians blamed for putting other road users at risk, their unmodern bodies and behavior imperiling the legitimate advance of motorized modernity","The principles of the free market, which had guided Britain’s conduct of its economic business in India for more than a century, had weakened in the interwar years; now they crumbled. As the state sought to impose controls—even typewriter sales became subject to state regulation—so black marketeering and smuggling thrived","Acute food shortages, culminating in the “man-made” Bengal famine of 1943, which claimed an estimated three million lives, forced the central and provincial governments in India to introduce unparalleled restrictions on the sale, distribution, and pricing of essential food grains","there was an often painful recognition that changing technology could bring radical changes to the relationship between peasants and urban workers on the one hand and landlords, industrial employers, and the state on the other. This was evident, for instance, on the streets of Indian cities, like Madras in December 1920, when striking mill workers found themselves confronted by trucks flled with armed police and strikebreakers.","From the 1890s onward, in cities like Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras, trams, taxis, buses, and private automobiles (driven by Europeans or by well-to-do Indians) repeatedly came under attack during demonstrations and riots."]},{"id":7,"name":"The_Sound_of_Things_to_Come_An_Audible_History_of_11640968_","highlights":["After a personal demonstration by Teremin in 1922, Lenin himself intended the inventor to tour the etherphone as a way of stimulating the electrifcation of the Soviet Union","First heard in Kurt Neumann’s Rocketship X-M (1950), the theremin would typify sonic science fction for about fve years","Music scholar Mark Brend notes that this closure of the gap between new sonic events and new sound-making methods is symptomatic of electronic music production:","Suvin’s emphasis on logical consistency, plausibility, and scientifc validation is meant to distinguish the narrative form of science fction from tales of fantasy and the supernatural","Te sonic novum’s reliance on such a high degree of material innovation is one of its most distinct features compared to other forms of science fctional novum.","the essential processes of musique concrète, our ability to “operate on sound” by controlling and altering “the physical signal fxed on the record or the tape.” Myriad “divergent sound eﬀects” can thus be rendered “from one material cause,” each one its own sonorous object","Tere were two major schools of thought and practice: the elektronische Musik studios of the national broadcaster, Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) in Cologne, Germany, and the Groupe de Recherche de Musique Concrète (GRMC) at the French Radio Institution in Paris","Attention, memory, imagination, and emotion map onto specifc visual techniques of the close-up, the ﬂashback, the dream sequence, and the special visual eﬀect.","By defnition, cinema is about authored moving image representations that provoke in the viewer an experience of immersion—a conscious state that relates the emotive-cognitive experiences of the viewer to the stream of events of the flm in such a manner that she momentarily can be claimed not to be fully conscious about the other events around her”","But substituting technical insight for critical engagement is one way that a spectacular medium keeps its audiences immersed not only in its end products but also in their manufacture.

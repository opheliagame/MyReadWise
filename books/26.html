The looks she receives at the beginning of the film shore her up, makes her feel beautiful, desirable, but she finds another kind of validation from within through an afternoon spent wandering in the city. Seeing the familiar sights of her neighbourhood with this new awareness of death and the impending decay of her beauty, Cléo sheds her synthetic self and finally reaches a state of calm self-awareness. The city refuses to let her wallow. It forces her gaze outward.</div>

That is an imaginary definition. Most French dictionaries don’t even include the word. The 1905 Littré does make an allowance for ‘flâneur, -euse’. Qui flâne. But the Dictionnaire Vivant de la Langue Française defines it, believe it or not, as a kind of lounge chair. Is that some kind of joke? The only kind of curious idling a woman does is lying down? This usage (slang of course) began around 1840 and peaked in the 1920s, but continues today: search for ‘flâneuse’ on Google Images and the word brings up a drawing of George Sand, a picture of a young woman sitting on a Parisian bench and a few images of outdoor furniture. * * *</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Now since men are by nature acquisitive, jealous, combative, and erotic, how shall we persuade them to behave themselves? By the policeman’s omnipresent club? It is a brutal method, costly and irritating. There is a better way, and that is by lending to the moral requirements of the community the sanction of supernatural authority. We must have a religion.</div>

Probably all three doctrines must be combined to find a perfect ethics; but can we doubt which of the elements is fundamental?</div>

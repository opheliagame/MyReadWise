        <div class="font-serif text-sm">I went to the girl, told her this was our last chance, and that she had to come. She refused, refused to stand up. &#39;I&#39;m not going anywhere with you. I don&#39;t trust you. I shall stay here where I&#39;m free.&#39; &#39;Free for what? To starve? To be frozen to death?&#39; I lifted her off the chair bodily, stood her on her feet. &#39;I won&#39;t goâ€”you can&#39;t force me.&#39; She backed away, wide-eyed, and stood against the wall, waiting for someone or something to rescue her. I lost patience, dragged her out of the building, went on holding her arm; I had to pull her along.</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">The endless celebrations here seemed both boring and sinister, reminiscent of the orgies of the plague years. Now, as then, people were deluding themselves; they induced a false sense of security by means of self- indulgence and wishful-thinking. I did not believe for one moment they had really escaped.</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">An insane impatience for death was driving mankind to a second suicide, even before the full effect of the first had been felt. I was profoundly depressed, left with a sense of waiting for something frightful to happen, a sort of mass execution.</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">From the doomed dying world man had ruined, I seemed to catch sigh of this other one, new, infinitely alive, and of boundless potential. For a second I believed myself capable of existing on higher level in that wonderful world; but saw how far it was beyond my powers when I thought of the girl, the warder the spreading ice, the fighting and killing. I was part of all that, irrevocably involved with events and persons upon this planet. It was heartbreaking to reject what a part of me wanted most. But I knew that my place was here, in our work under sentence of death, and that I would have to stay and see it through to the end.</div>

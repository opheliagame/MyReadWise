        <div class="font-serif text-sm">It is interesting to think about the fact that deception and “con games” are a way of life in all species and throughout nature. Organisms that do not improve their ability to deceive—and to detect deception—are less apt to survive</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">the consequences of concealing even the most “ordinary” information in families can be far-reaching, because the selective sharing and guarding of information is the stuff of which “insiders” and “outsiders” are made in social groups</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Recognizing a shared experience helps us stop pathologizing ourselves. Instead of maintaining a narrow and singular focus on the question, “What’s wrong with me?”, we can begin to ask other questions, like “Who says?”, “What group of people has created this reality for us?”, “How does it serve them?”, “What would be different if we stopped believing it?</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">In psychoanaltyic circles, for example, many of my colleagues still considered the clitoris to be a vestigial organ in adult sexuality; women who preferred clitoral to vaginal stimulation were labeled “masculine” or “phallic” (as were those of us who aspired to be mathematicians or engineers), and were diagnosed as manifesting penis envy or sexual immaturity.</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">It is not enough to exchange stories in a consciousness-raising group, at a women’s conference, or with our five closest friends. Our sense of what is real and true suffers when we are unable to do this in our own families</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Family members equate these intense, anxiety-driven confrontations with being honest, then blame the other person for not changing (“…and then my mother got so defensive! She just can’t accept the truth”). In reality, openness and truth-telling don’t begin until at least one person calms down, steps out of the soup, and begins to really think rather than to merely react</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">She suffered from what the poet Lynn Sukenick has called “matraphobia”—the fear of being one’s mother. When we must be as unlike our mothers as possible, we rule out the opportunity to discover and invent our real selves, just as we do when we feel compelled to be exactly the same as her</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">The relationship with the same-sex parent is, of course, particularly pivotal for the development of authenticity and self-regard. As her mother’s apprentice, a daughter watches to see what it means to be a wife, a mother, and an adult woman. A daughter is sensitively attuned to the quality of her mother’s life and to how her mother conducts her key relationships, including those with her own family of origin. When a daughter senses her mother’s unhappiness or sees through her lies and silence, she may volunteer to fill up her mother’s empty bucket, fix her depression, live out her thwarted dreams, or wave her mother’s banner at the expense of having a relationship with Dad. It is not simply that parents assign their children to a particular role, like “the happy one” or “Mom’s best friend. ” A child may volunteer for such an impossible job in the family without even being asked.</div>

      <div class="grid grid-rows-card rounded-md shadow-md p-4 bg-white">
        
        
        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Women frequently leave a part of themselves at home. That is, we may sacrifice important aspects of the self in an unconscious effort to be for our mothers.</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">When I first met Bea, she was too angry and intense to broach an emotionally loaded subject with Ruth. Intensity breeds more intensity, only adding to the anxious emotional climate that blocked truth-telling to begin with. Moves toward truth-telling may require us to maintain a calm, emotional presence in an anxious emotional field.Paradoxically, this translates into being “less real” in order to help create an emotional climate in which people can be “more real. ” That is, if “being real” is defined as doing what comes naturally, which in Bea’s case meant angrily avoiding or confronting Ruth. This kind of “realness” or “truth-telling” invariably shuts the lines of communication down even further.</div>

      <div class="grid grid-rows-card rounded-md shadow-md p-4 bg-white">
        
        
        <div class="font-serif text-sm">When I was younger, I believed that timing and tact were the opposites of honesty. Now I believe instead that timing and tact are what make truth-telling possible in the most difficult circumstances and in regard to the toughest subjects</div>

      <div class="grid grid-rows-card rounded-md shadow-md p-4 bg-white">
        
        
        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Why bother?” That was my response to a friend many years ago who challenged me to open up an emotion-laden issue in my own family—slowly, responsibly, and with care, and with a plan to manage the inevitable resistance evoked by change.Interestingly, it was no bother to me to try steadily yet clumsily to be in conversation with women halfway around the world.Today, my response would be, instead, “Why not bother?” There is, perhaps, no more direct route to discovering our own truths than to unearth the stories in our immediate and extended family. The stories of our family members are our stories, these stories “are us,” and it is in the exchanging and refining of personal experiences that we can come to know our own truths.</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Contrary to what the dictionary tells us, pretending is potentially the most serious form of deception because it can involve living a lie, rather than telling one. And we are least likely to catch ourselves in the act. When we tell an outright lie, we feel jolted. But pretending is imperceptibly woven into the fabric of daily life and so leads to the construction of a false self. We may not feel any jolts along the way, because we are, after all, “just pretending. ” In time, we don’t notice ourselves doing it at all.</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Obviously, we do have aspects of the self that are relatively stable and enduring, predictable, and even rigidly patterned. And some aspects of the self are not negotiable under relationship pressures. We do not, however, have one “true self” that we can choose to either hide or authentically share with others.Rather, we have multiple potentials and possibilities that different situations will evoke or suppress, make more or less likely, and assign more or less positive or negative values to.</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">As Minnich observes, the number of prefixes, or “markers,” increases as we move down the traditional hierarchy. One can study “Women’s History” or “Black Women’s History” or “Black, Third-World Women’s History. ” But what of the white Euro-American heterosexual privileged male? His history is simply “history. ” His writing is simply “literature. ” He alone is not prefixed. He then, Minnich notes, becomes the generic human, the defining center, the one whose partial and particular truths are generalized to the whole</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">The poet Adrienne Rich speaks to this point in her notes on women, honor, and lying. It is not, she writes, that we have to tell everything, or to tell all at once, or even to know beforehand all that we need to tell. But an honorable relationship, she reminds us, is one in which we are trying, all the time, to extend the possibilities of truth between us, of life between us</div>

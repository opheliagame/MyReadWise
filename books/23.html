        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Born of those working groups were articles, conference presentations, and books, including the first CCS manuscript, the ten-authored 10 PRINT CHR$(205.5+RND(1)); : GOTO 10 (Montfort et al. 2013; aka 10 PRINT), which analyzed the code of its title. Wendy Chun (Marino 2010a) presented what would be her first chapter of Programmed Visions (2011). Dennis Jerz (2011) offered the FORTRAN code of William Crowther’s Adventure for collective annotation. Mark Sample’s “Criminal Code: Procedural Logic and Rhetorical Excess in Videogames” (2013) offers a reading of C++ code in the video game Micropolis, the forerunner to Sim City.28 Tara McPherson presented an early version of her analysis of the intersections of the civil rights movement and the development of Unix (2010; revised and extended in 2018). Federica Frabetti offered a take on a misread bug in the code of the first space probe, Mariner 1 (2010)</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Subsequently, several books have expanded the cultural contexts for examination of code. David M. Berry’s The Philosophy of Software (2011) takes up a formal consideration of the ontology and epistemology of code, as does Adrian Mackenzie’s Cutting Code (2006). Bradley Dilger and Jeff Rice have collected reflections that center on HTML tokens in A to &lt;A&gt; (2010). As I’ve mentioned, Speaking Code (2012) by Geoff Cox and Alex McLean offers an exploration of the way code acts as speech in the form of a duet, with text by Cox intertwined with code passages by McLean. D. Fox Harrell’s Phantasmal Media (2013) offers programming as a potentially disruptive culturally situated practice. James Brown Jr. applies rhetorical theory to code in Ethical Programs: Hospitality and the Rhetorics of Software (2015). In Coding Literacy: How Computer Programming Is Changing Writing (2017), Annette Vee analyzes code from a legal perspective and examines what the framework of literacy brings to larger conversations about teaching code in cultures. Finally, the most recent work, Kevin Brock’s Rhetorical Code Studies (2019), offers a specific application of critical code studies that reads code as a means of rhetorical discourse</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">There are quite a few texts that take up the ontology of code. Chun’s Programmed Visions (2011) and Hayles’s My Mother Was a Computer (2005) offer important interventions that situate computation and our fascination with it. Gabriella Coleman’s Coding Freedom (2012) takes up the ethos of the culture of open-source programming. Jussi Parikka’s Digital Contagions (2007), although containing very little code, offers a robust media archaeology of viruses and worms. Because of their philosophical interventions into the study of technoculture, these works provide a foundation for readings of code.</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Perhaps it can be said of code what da Vinci said of art: It is never finished, merely abandoned, meaning that code as a unit of mechanisms is always partial and potential. It can always be improved, developed, reworked, reimagined, and repurposed</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">The focus of CCS is not on making code that has aesthetic value and additional meaning but on a view of code as already having meaning beyond its functionality because it is a form of symbolic expression and interaction</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Interpretation in the humanities sense is more akin to porting a program from one language to another, where a programmer has to make conscious choices about how to represent one system in another and the porting requires a subjective assessment of what is the essence of the program. Yet interpretation in the humanities goes beyond compiling and porting because it asks, “If x represents y, what is being communicated about both systems?” It asks, “How does one realm of meaning inform or affect another?” In other words, interpretation in the humanities sense is neither deciphering nor translating, but instead uses those techniques (and other hermeneutics) to get at meaning beyond the isomorphic systems. Interpretation then is not merely decoding but the production of another kind of knowledge: insight.</div>

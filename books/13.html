        <div class="font-serif text-sm">The definitive book on niggly cartographic subjects is most often written not by a curator or an academic but by some enthusiastic amateur. Map collectors are history buffs, in other words, and often ones with deep pockets.</div>
      </div>
    
      <div class="grid grid-rows-card rounded-md shadow-md p-4 bg-white">
        
        
        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Even more remarkable is the story of Nain Singh, the Bhotian schoolteacher who spent the better part of ten years exploring the Himalayan “roof of the world” for the British.</div>
      </div>
    
      <div class="grid grid-rows-card rounded-md shadow-md p-4 bg-white">
        
        
        <div class="font-serif text-sm">But map knowledge has always been guarded with great secrecy. In 1504, King Manuel I of Portugal declared that anyone leaving his kingdom with a single Portuguese map would receive the death penalty. He did so for the same reason that map dealers keep mum about their clients today: to protect a trade monopoly. The geopolitical equivalent of the space race at that time was a “spice race” for Asian cinnamon, pepper, and nutmeg, and Vasco da Gama had just given Portugal a crucial edge by charting a sea route to India. Keeping Spain in the dark about his discoveries was a crucial matter of national security.</div>
      </div>
    
      <div class="grid grid-rows-card rounded-md shadow-md p-4 bg-white">
        
        
        <div class="font-serif text-sm">But if I bring up the same coordinates on Naver, by far the most popular South Korean search engine, my childhood has been erased. The contours of the military garrison have been carefully filled with imagery of forested mountainside, no doubt for government-imposed security reasons.</div>
      </div>
    
      <div class="grid grid-rows-card rounded-md shadow-md p-4 bg-white">
        
        
        <div class="font-serif text-sm">The fact that early collectors were so proud to display their maps tells us that there may have been some self-interest at play here, beyond just an idle aesthetic or intellectual pursuit. Displaying maps gave you prestige; it was easy shorthand for “See how educated I am!” or “See how far-reaching my business interests are!”* A college sophomore is hoping for the same effect today when he casually adds a German beer stein or a poster of the Montmartre steps to his dorm room decor after returning from a summer in Europe.</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Maps of fictional places are a peculiarity of childhood, but among adults, they’re a peculiarity of geek culture as well. Harry Potter’s Hogwarts and the starship Enterprise have been mapped in more detail than much of Africa,</div>
      </div>
    
      <div class="grid grid-rows-card rounded-md shadow-md p-4 bg-white">
        
        
        <div class="font-serif text-sm">If most kids grow out of made-up maps around the time they discover girls,† you might think that the prevalence of kiddie maps in geeky pastimes like these is just another sign of arrested development, like eating Hot Pockets and playing Halo all night even though you’re in your thirties.</div>
      </div>
    
      <div class="grid grid-rows-card rounded-md shadow-md p-4 bg-white">
        
        
        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Maps of the Arctic tundra or Darkest Africa didn’t cut it for young adventurers anymore; they had to look elsewhere for new blank spaces to dream about. And so they found Middle-earth, Prydain, Cimmeria, Earthsea, Shannara.</div>
      </div>
    
      <div class="grid grid-rows-card rounded-md shadow-md p-4 bg-white">
        
        
        <div class="font-serif text-sm">My immediate assumption is that the root of the achievement gap is spatial ability. Tests on gender and navigation have found that women tend to navigate via landmarks (“I turn left when I get to the gas station”) whereas men use dead reckoning (“I still need to be north and maybe a little west of here”), which ties in nicely with the evolutionary perspective: early men went out on hunting expeditions in all directions and always needed to be good at finding their way back to the cave, developing their “kinesic memory,” while women foraged for edibles closer to home, developing “object location memory.” Simply put, men got better at finding places, while women got better at finding things.</div>

      <div class="grid grid-rows-card rounded-md shadow-md p-4 bg-white">
        
        
        <div class="font-serif text-sm">In fact, it’s so axiomatic that geocaching will reveal the hidden secrets of your neighborhood that there’s even an acronym in the trade for it: YAPIDKA, meaning “Yet Another Park I Didn’t Know About.”</div>
      </div>
    
      <div class="grid grid-rows-card rounded-md shadow-md p-4 bg-white">
        
        
        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Cachers will go to great lengths to avoid being spotted while hiding or retrieving a geocache, because all it takes is one too-curious onlooker and the secret spot might be “Muggled” (plundered) and thereby ruined for future seekers. So there’s a clandestine thrill to the sport, almost reminiscent of Cold War–era double espionage: lots of long, chilly waits on park benches pretending to feed birds and cautious drive-bys of prearranged “dead drops” on lonely country roads.</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Just weeks after Frank’s challenge was posted, two Canadian brothers named Jonathan and Duncan Rawlinson, traveling from London to Portugal, made a side trip into the hills of southern Spain to lay a half baguette on the dusty ground, while an Internet co-conspirator did the same thing near his home in Auckland, New Zealand. The first Earth sandwich in human history had been completed.</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">In a famous passage published in 1982, Margaret Atwood explains how when she asked a male friend why men feel threatened by women, he said, “They’re afraid women will laugh at them.… Undercut their world view.” But when she asked some of her women students why women feel threatened by men, they told her, “They’re afraid of being killed.”</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Romantic love, as de Beauvoir sees it, is damaging and dangerous to both women and men. It encourages women to seek their own annihilation through absorption into a man’s life and identity—otherwise, they risk being seen as unwomanly. But this is devastating to all the things that de Beauvoir, as an existentialist, considers necessary for an “authentic” life, in particular the freedom to choose one’s own path. Moreover, women in romantic love are taught to see their male partners as impossibly idealized, since otherwise their own annihilation would be too obviously irrational. But no man is impossibly ideal. The inevitable failure to live up to the prescribed manly role in patriarchal romantic love thus ultimately makes love deeply damaging for men as well.</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Romantic love is like this. Some of our ancient, evolved biological machinery—a collection of neural pathways and chemical responses—is currently playing the starring role of Romantic Love in a show called Modern Society.</div>
      </div>
    
      <div class="grid grid-rows-card rounded-md shadow-md p-4 bg-white">
        
        
        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Social constraints can be powerful, but love’s biology is powerful too. No amount of determination to construct a social role for love that excluded queer people managed to shut down the biological machinery of queer love. Over time, the biology won out: the social role expanded to become a better fit for love’s biological reality.</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">biological determinism about gender and biological determinism about love often go hand in hand: “Lovers gonna love” tends to line up neatly alongside “Boys will be boys.”</div>
      </div>
    
      <div class="grid grid-rows-card rounded-md shadow-md p-4 bg-white">
        
        
        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Love’s social role is to take adult attraction and affection and output something resembling a stable nuclear family unit. Where there is resistance to the formation of family-like bonds between queer people or between people racialized into different groups, there is a corresponding resistance to the idea of romantic love between such people. This can take the form of mere disapproval, but even more powerfully, it can take the form of denials that such love is so much as possible. This then leads to the conclusion that any queer or interracial relationship must really be a matter of sexual attraction alone. Because of negative attitudes toward sex in general, this incurs disapproval and disrespect. The desired—and likely—consequence is that, under such pressure and without the normal social supports, the relationship will be unable to fulfill the social function of creating a stable family unit. In terms of Beall and Sternberg’s social constructionism (explored back in chapter 2), we can identify this as one of society’s regulative mechanisms for stamping out disfavored manifestations of love.</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Gendered assumptions about how a romantic relationship is supposed to look can have a significant impact on our lives even if we don’t notice it. One fascinating study by psychologists Laurie Rudman and Jessica Heppen found that women who thought of their romantic partners in terms of “chivalry and heroism” (i.e., as knights in shining armor) were on average less interested in pursuing high-status occupations for themselves and less ambitious when it came to earnings, education, and leadership goals.</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">As she saw it, advances in civilization were destroying the biological basis for that power imbalance, so it had become necessary to shore it up with social institutions. Firestone thought romantic love was one such institution, along with the patriarchal nuclear family. For this reason, she called romanticism “a cultural tool of male power to keep women from knowing their condition.”</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">the genders in the Cinderella story are a big part of its “romantic” appeal: high-status women who marry low-status men are not viewed in quite the same light.)</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">In addition to the general instability associated with change of any kind, love has a special place in defining who we think we are and how we think we should live. Expanding the social role of romantic love to include interracial relationships is highly destabilizing to a social order that is rigidly segregated on racial lines. The inclusion of same-sex love—and, more generally, challenging established romantic gender roles—is similarly destabilizing to a social order that expects wives to provide domestic labor for husbands who work outside the home.</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">While men may aspire to the status of “confirmed bachelor,” women are given the prospect of becoming a “crazy old cat lady.” Even the simple word “spinster” suggests a dull, sexless woman who is probably deeply weird in some way: if you’re lucky, Miss Marple; if you’re unlucky, Miss Havisham.</div>

        <div class="font-serif text-sm">Serious interventions into the biology of love are only recently starting to sound realistic. But the idea of inducing or curing love with potions, lotions, balms, ointments, or basically anything we can get our hands on is an ancient one. It’s been pervasive in art, literature, and medicine for thousands of years.</div>

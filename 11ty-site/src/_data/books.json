      "“God is not a puppeteer who pulls all the strings, controlling everything that happens. A real puppet master controls the puppets from outside and is therefore the ‘outer cause’ of the puppet’s movements. But that is not the way God controls the world. God controls the world through natural laws. So God—or nature—is the ‘inner cause’ of everything that happens. This means that everything in the material world happens through necessity. Spinoza had a determinist view of the material, or natural, world.”",

Man can strive for freedom in order to live without outer constraint, but he will never achieve ‘free will.’ We do not control everything that happens in our body—which is a mode of the attribute of extension. Neither do we ‘choose’ our thinking. Man therefore does not have a ‘free soul’; it is more or less imprisoned in a mechanical body.”",

And around him, I freed my true self: giggly and gullible, a lounger, insecure, a late sleeper who woke to bedsheets wet by sweat, ticklish, cold-toed, an unintentional killer of plants, pessimistic, exhausted, alone.

It encourages women to seek their own annihilation through absorption into a man’s life and identity—otherwise, they risk being seen as unwomanly. But this is devastating to all the things that de Beauvoir, as an existentialist, considers necessary for an “authentic” life, in particular the freedom to choose one’s own path. Moreover, women in romantic love are taught to see their male partners as impossibly idealized, since otherwise their own annihilation would be too obviously irrational. But no man is impossibly ideal. The inevitable failure to live up to the prescribed manly role in patriarchal romantic love thus ultimately makes love deeply damaging for men as well.",

      "Social constraints can be powerful, but love’s biology is powerful too. No amount of determination to construct a social role for love that excluded queer people managed to shut down the biological machinery of queer love.

      "biological determinism about gender and biological determinism about love often go hand in hand: “Lovers gonna love” tends to line up neatly alongside “Boys will be boys.”",
      "Love’s social role is to take adult attraction and affection and output something resembling a stable nuclear family unit. Where there is resistance to the formation of family-like bonds between queer people or between people racialized into different groups, there is a corresponding resistance to the idea of romantic love between such people. This can take the form of mere disapproval, but even more powerfully, it can take the form of denials that such love is so much as possible. This then leads to the conclusion that any queer or interracial relationship must really be a matter of sexual attraction alone. Because of negative attitudes toward sex in general, this incurs disapproval and disrespect. The desired—and likely—consequence is that, under such pressure and without the normal social supports, the relationship will be unable to fulfill the social function of creating a stable family unit. In terms of Beall and Sternberg’s social constructionism (explored back in chapter 2), we can identify this as one of society’s regulative mechanisms for stamping out disfavored manifestations of love.",
      "Gendered assumptions about how a romantic relationship is supposed to look can have a significant impact on our lives even if we don’t notice it. One fascinating study by psychologists Laurie Rudman and Jessica Heppen found that women who thought of their romantic partners in terms of “chivalry and heroism” (i.e., as knights in shining armor) were on average less interested in pursuing high-status occupations for themselves and less ambitious when it came to earnings, education, and leadership goals.",
      "As she saw it, advances in civilization were destroying the biological basis for that power imbalance, so it had become necessary to shore it up with social institutions.

Expanding the social role of romantic love to include interracial relationships is highly destabilizing to a social order that is rigidly segregated on racial lines. The inclusion of same-sex love—and, more generally, challenging established romantic gender roles—is similarly destabilizing to a social order that expects wives to provide domestic labor for husbands who work outside the home.",
      "While men may aspire to the status of “confirmed bachelor,” women are given the prospect of becoming a “crazy old cat lady.” Even the simple word “spinster” suggests a dull, sexless woman who is probably deeply weird in some way: if you’re lucky, Miss Marple; if you’re unlucky, Miss Havisham.",

In Madagascar, a half-hour was a “rice cooking,” and a brief moment was “frying a locust.” When they had clocks, people increasingly thought about time as something related to money. Thompson noted that “time is now currency, it is not passed but spent.”"

Wendy Chun (Marino 2010a) presented what would be her first chapter of Programmed Visions (2011). Dennis Jerz (2011) offered the FORTRAN code of William Crowther’s Adventure for collective annotation. Mark Sample’s “Criminal Code: Procedural Logic and Rhetorical Excess in Videogames” (2013) offers a reading of C++ code in the video game Micropolis, the forerunner to Sim City.28 Tara McPherson presented an early version of her analysis of the intersections of the civil rights movement and the development of Unix (2010; revised and extended in 2018). Federica Frabetti offered a take on a misread bug in the code of the first space probe, Mariner 1 (2010)",
      "Subsequently, several books have expanded the cultural contexts for examination of code. David M. Berry’s The Philosophy of Software (2011) takes up a formal consideration of the ontology and epistemology of code, as does Adrian Mackenzie’s Cutting Code (2006). Bradley Dilger and Jeff Rice have collected reflections that center on HTML tokens in A to <A> (2010). As I’ve mentioned, Speaking Code (2012) by Geoff Cox and Alex McLean offers an exploration of the way code acts as speech in the form of a duet, with text by Cox intertwined with code passages by McLean. D. Fox Harrell’s Phantasmal Media (2013) offers programming as a potentially disruptive culturally situated practice. James Brown Jr. applies rhetorical theory to code in Ethical Programs: Hospitality and the Rhetorics of Software (2015). In Coding Literacy: How Computer Programming Is Changing Writing (2017), Annette Vee analyzes code from a legal perspective and examines what the framework of literacy brings to larger conversations about teaching code in cultures. Finally, the most recent work, Kevin Brock’s Rhetorical Code Studies (2019), offers a specific application of critical code studies that reads code as a means of rhetorical discourse",
      "There are quite a few texts that take up the ontology of code. Chun’s Programmed Visions (2011) and Hayles’s My Mother Was a Computer (2005) offer important interventions that situate computation and our fascination with it. Gabriella Coleman’s Coding Freedom (2012) takes up the ethos of the culture of open-source programming. Jussi Parikka’s Digital Contagions (2007), although containing very little code, offers a robust media archaeology of viruses and worms. Because of their philosophical interventions into the study of technoculture, these works provide a foundation for readings of code.",
      "Perhaps it can be said of code what da Vinci said of art: It is never finished, merely abandoned, meaning that code as a unit of mechanisms is always partial and potential. It can always be improved, developed, reworked, reimagined, and repurposed",
      "The focus of CCS is not on making code that has aesthetic value and additional meaning but on a view of code as already having meaning beyond its functionality because it is a form of symbolic expression and interaction",
      "Interpretation in the humanities sense is more akin to porting a program from one language to another, where a programmer has to make conscious choices about how to represent one system in another and the porting requires a subjective assessment of what is the essence of the program. Yet interpretation in the humanities goes beyond compiling and porting because it asks, “If x represents y, what is being communicated about both systems?” It asks, “How does one realm of meaning inform or affect another?” In other words, interpretation in the humanities sense is neither deciphering nor translating, but instead uses those techniques (and other hermeneutics) to get at meaning beyond the isomorphic systems. Interpretation then is not merely decoding but the production of another kind of knowledge: insight."

      "The current imperial family traces its hereditary line back to the early sixth century. It emerged as the Yamato family of chief priests and priestesses presiding over one of several clans contending for political supremacy (eight early monarchs were women). By the early 700s, this Yamato clan had achieved unchallenged political as well as sacred authority. It built a capital city and commissioned the writing of historical chronicles that invented a mythic genealogical line extending back from the sixth century c.e. through twenty-eight legendary rulers to 660 b.c.e. This ancient mythology was revived in the late nineteenth century as the orthodox “modern” view of imperial history",

That means that the African himself has doubts about his capacity to transform and develop his natural environment",
      "One of the common means by which one nation exploits another and one that is relevant to Africa’s external relations is exploitation through trade. When the terms of trade are set by one country in a manner entirely advantageous to itself, then the trade is usually detrimental to the trading partner. To be specific, one can take the export of agricultural produce from Africa and the import of manufactured goods into Africa from Europe, North America and Japan",
      "More far-reaching than just trade is the actual ownership of the means of production in one country by the citizens of another",
      "draw a clear distinction between the capitalist countries and the socialist ones, because socialist countries have never at any time owned any part of the African continent nor do they invest in African economies in such a way as to expatriate profits from Africa.

      "However, it is not being suggested that African agriculture in the early period was superior lo that of other continents. On the contrary, African standards of husbandry on the land and with livestock were not as high as those independently evolved in most parts of Asia and Europe. The weakness in Africa seemed to have been the lack of a professional interest in acquiring more scientific knowledge and in devising tools to lighten the load of labour as well as to transform hostile environments into areas suitable for human activity. As far as agriculture in Europe was concerned, this professionalism was undertaken by the class with a vested interest in the land — namely, the feudalist landowners and later the capitalist farmers",

In India, a limited Buddhist influence was overwhelmed by that of the Hindus and Muslims; and of course in feudal Europe it was the Catholic Church which played the role paralleled by the Orthodox Church in Ethiopia",

The contention here is that over that period Africa helped to develop Western Europe in the same proportion as Western Europe helped to underdevelop Africa.",
      "From the beginning, Europe assumed the power to make decisions within the international trading system. An excellent illustration of that is the fact that the so-called international law which governed the conduct of nations on the high seas was nothing else but European law",
      "Europe allocated to Africa the role of supplier of human captives to be used as slaves in various parts of the world.",
      "The fact that Europe was the first part of the world to move from feudalism towards capitalism gave Europeans a headstart over humanity elsewhere in the scientific understanding of the universe, the making of tools and the efficient organisation of labour. European technical superiority did not apply to all aspects of production, but the advantage which they possessed in a few key areas proved decisive",

      "As seen earlier, exploitation of land and labour is essential for human social advance, but only on the assumption that the product is made available within the area where the exploitation takes place. Colonialism was not merely a system of exploitation, but one whose essential purpose was to repatriate the profits to the so-called ‘mother country’",
      "When discrepancies such as the above were pointed out during the colonial period and subsequently, those who justified colonialism were quick to reply that the standard and cost of living was higher in capitalist countries",
      "1934, fortyone Africans were killed in a gold mine disaster in the Gold Coast, and the capitalist company offered only £3 to the dependants of each of these men as compensation",
      "A peasant growing a cash crop or collecting produce had his labour exploited by a long chain of individuals, starting with local businessmen. Sometimes, those local businessmen were Europeans. Very rarely were they Africans, and more usually they were a minority group brought in from outside and serving as intermediaries between the white colonialists and the exploited African peasant. In West Africa, the Lebanese and Syrians played this role; while in East Africa the Indians rose to this position. Arabs were also in the middleman category in Zanzibar and a few other places on the East African coast.",
      "The capitalist institution which came into most direct contact with African peasants was the colonial trading company: that is to say, a company specialising in moving goods to and from the colonies",
      "The African peasant went in for cash-crop farming for many reasons. A minority eagerly took up the opportunity to continue to acquire European goods, which they had become accustomed to during the pre-colonial period. Many others in every section of the continent took to earning cash because they had to pay various taxes in money or because they were forced to work.",
      "Although the trading companies received less for every ton of palm oil during the depression years, their profit margin increased – showing how brazenly surplus was being pounded out of the peasant. In the midst of the depression the UAC was showing a handsome profit. The profits in 1934 were £6,302,875 and a dividend of 15% was paid on ordinary shares.",

From 1929 to 1931, the UAC (backed by Unilever) engaged in an economic war with the West African Lines Conference – comprising the British shipping firm of EIder Dempster, the Holland West Africa Line and a German West Africa Line.",
      "The returns on colonial investment were consistently higher than those on investments in the metropoles, so the financiers stood to benefit from sponsoring colonial enterprise",
      "One of the main purposes of the colonial taxation system was to provide requisite funds for administering the colony as a field of exploitation. European colonisers ensured that Africans paid for the upkeep of the governors and police who oppressed them and served as watchdogs for private capitalists",
      "The French colonies were especially victimised in this respect. Particularly since 1921, the local revenue raised from taxation had to meet all expenses as well as to build up a reserve",
      "In some areas, such as West Africa, Africans had become so attached to European manufactures during the early period of trade that, on their own initiative, they were prepared to go to great lengths to participate in the colonial money economy. But that was not the universal response. In many instances, Africans did not consider the monetary incentives great enough to justify changing their way of life so as to become labourers or cash-crop farmers. In such cases, the colonial state intervened to use law, taxation and outright force to make Africans pursue a line favourable to capitalist profits",
      "In Congo, brutal and extensive forced labour started under King Leopold in the last century. So many Congolese were killed and maimed by Leopold’s officials and police that this earned European disapproval even in the midst of the general pattern of colonial outrages.",

      "It would be extremely simple-minded to say that colonialism in Africa or anywhere else caused Europe to develop its science and technology. The tendency towards technological innovation and renovation was inherent in capitalism itself, because of the drive for profits",
      "As John Stuart Mill said, the trade between England and the West Indies in the 18th century was like the trade between town and country. In the present century, the links are even closer and it is more marked that the town (Europe) is living off the countryside (Africa, Asia and Latin America). When it said that colonies should exist for the metropoles by producing raw materials and buying manufactured goods, the underlying theory was to introduce an international division of labour covering working people everywhere. That is to say, up to that point, each society had allocated to its own members particular functions in production-some hunted, some made clothes, some built houses, etc. But with colonialism, the capitalists determined what types of labour the workers should carry on in the world at large. Africans were to dig minerals out of the sub-soil, grow agricultural crops, collect natural products and perform a number of other odds and ends such as bicycle repairing. Inside of Europe, North America and Japan, workers would refine the minerals and the raw materials and make the bicycles.",
      "The Industrial Revolution in Europe during the 18th and 19th centuries was the Age of Steam. In a parallel manner, the colonial epoch was the Age of Electricity. Therefore, the vital copper exports from Congo, Northern Rhodesia and other parts of Africa were contributing to the leading sector of European technology. From that strategic position, its multiplier effects were innumerable and were of incalculable benefit to capitalist development.",

      "Colonialism was based on alien political rule and was restricted to some parts of the world. Imperialism, however, underlay all colonies, extended all over the world (except where replaced by Socialist revolutions), and it allowed the participation of all capitalist nations. Therefore, lack of colonies on the part of any capitalist nation was not a barrier to enjoying the fruits of exploiting the colonial and semi-colonial world, which was the backyard of metropolitan capitalism.",

She is like my daughter.” And it was true: he had asked me not to bother covering my head in front of him, only to make sure that it was covered if others were around, because, as he explained, “this is a village and people are not so open-minded.” In fact, people there were curious to see if a city girl like me could manage the housework.

      "the consequences of concealing even the most “ordinary” information in families can be far-reaching, because the selective sharing and guarding of information is the stuff of which “insiders” and “outsiders” are made in social groups",
      "Recognizing a shared experience helps us stop pathologizing ourselves. Instead of maintaining a narrow and singular focus on the question, “What’s wrong with me?”, we can begin to ask other questions, like “Who says?”, “What group of people has created this reality for us?”, “How does it serve them?”, “What would be different if we stopped believing it?",
      "In psychoanaltyic circles, for example, many of my colleagues still considered the clitoris to be a vestigial organ in adult sexuality; women who preferred clitoral to vaginal stimulation were labeled “masculine” or “phallic” (as were those of us who aspired to be mathematicians or engineers), and were diagnosed as manifesting penis envy or sexual immaturity.",
      "A more parsimonious explanation is that dead-end jobs evoke dead-end dreams, while new opportunities evoke new desires and, ultimately, new stories about our “true self.",
      "Family therapist Betty Carter notes that mothers routinely tell their daughters what they think is helpful rather than conveying their true doubts, fears, struggles, and uncertainties.This, she notes, reflects a mother’s effort to fulfill her impossible responsibility of raising perfect children",
      "It is not enough to exchange stories in a consciousness-raising group, at a women’s conference, or with our five closest friends. Our sense of what is real and true suffers when we are unable to do this in our own families",
      "Painful events that have not been processed in past generations will remain embedded in a family, and will be reenacted with each new generation.",
      "Family members equate these intense, anxiety-driven confrontations with being honest, then blame the other person for not changing (“…and then my mother got so defensive! She just can’t accept the truth”). In reality, openness and truth-telling don’t begin until at least one person calms down, steps out of the soup, and begins to really think rather than to merely react",
      "She suffered from what the poet Lynn Sukenick has called “matraphobia”—the fear of being one’s mother. When we must be as unlike our mothers as possible, we rule out the opportunity to discover and invent our real selves, just as we do when we feel compelled to be exactly the same as her",
      "Like many daughters, Bea had learned to expect nothing from her father and everything from her mother",
      "The relationship with the same-sex parent is, of course, particularly pivotal for the development of authenticity and self-regard. As her mother’s apprentice, a daughter watches to see what it means to be a wife, a mother, and an adult woman. A daughter is sensitively attuned to the quality of her mother’s life and to how her mother conducts her key relationships, including those with her own family of origin. When a daughter senses her mother’s unhappiness or sees through her lies and silence, she may volunteer to fill up her mother’s empty bucket, fix her depression, live out her thwarted dreams, or wave her mother’s banner at the expense of having a relationship with Dad. It is not simply that parents assign their children to a particular role, like “the happy one” or “Mom’s best friend. ” A child may volunteer for such an impossible job in the family without even being asked.",
      "Women frequently leave a part of themselves at home. That is, we may sacrifice important aspects of the self in an unconscious effort to be for our mothers.",
      "When I first met Bea, she was too angry and intense to broach an emotionally loaded subject with Ruth. Intensity breeds more intensity, only adding to the anxious emotional climate that blocked truth-telling to begin with. Moves toward truth-telling may require us to maintain a calm, emotional presence in an anxious emotional field.Paradoxically, this translates into being “less real” in order to help create an emotional climate in which people can be “more real. ” That is, if “being real” is defined as doing what comes naturally, which in Bea’s case meant angrily avoiding or confronting Ruth. This kind of “realness” or “truth-telling” invariably shuts the lines of communication down even further.",
      "When I was younger, I believed that timing and tact were the opposites of honesty. Now I believe instead that timing and tact are what make truth-telling possible in the most difficult circumstances and in regard to the toughest subjects",
      "Why bother?” That was my response to a friend many years ago who challenged me to open up an emotion-laden issue in my own family—slowly, responsibly, and with care, and with a plan to manage the inevitable resistance evoked by change.Interestingly, it was no bother to me to try steadily yet clumsily to be in conversation with women halfway around the world.Today, my response would be, instead, “Why not bother?” There is, perhaps, no more direct route to discovering our own truths than to unearth the stories in our immediate and extended family. The stories of our family members are our stories, these stories “are us,” and it is in the exchanging and refining of personal experiences that we can come to know our own truths.",
      "Contrary to what the dictionary tells us, pretending is potentially the most serious form of deception because it can involve living a lie, rather than telling one. And we are least likely to catch ourselves in the act. When we tell an outright lie, we feel jolted. But pretending is imperceptibly woven into the fabric of daily life and so leads to the construction of a false self. We may not feel any jolts along the way, because we are, after all, “just pretending. ” In time, we don’t notice ourselves doing it at all.",
      "pretending is potentially the most serious form of deception because it can involve living a lie, rather than telling one",
      "One can discover in pretending that one has allowed for the emergence or invention of something “more real.",
      "The body does not “forget. ” It is not uncommon for people to begin to uncover traumatic memories during movement, breathing exercises, deep massage, or various kinds of therapeutic body work",
      "But the advice to be one’s true self, and to value one’s true self apart from context and how others respond to us, is as absurd as it is advisable.",
      "Obviously, we do have aspects of the self that are relatively stable and enduring, predictable, and even rigidly patterned. And some aspects of the self are not negotiable under relationship pressures. We do not, however, have one “true self” that we can choose to either hide or authentically share with others.Rather, we have multiple potentials and possibilities that different situations will evoke or suppress, make more or less likely, and assign more or less positive or negative values to.",
      "As Minnich observes, the number of prefixes, or “markers,” increases as we move down the traditional hierarchy. One can study “Women’s History” or “Black Women’s History” or “Black, Third-World Women’s History. ” But what of the white Euro-American heterosexual privileged male? His history is simply “history. ” His writing is simply “literature. ” He alone is not prefixed. He then, Minnich notes, becomes the generic human, the defining center, the one whose partial and particular truths are generalized to the whole",
      "Generalizations are stories that we become if we believe them.“Beware of the stories you tell,” one psychologist warns, “for you will surely be lived by them.",
      "The poet Adrienne Rich speaks to this point in her notes on women, honor, and lying. It is not, she writes, that we have to tell everything, or to tell all at once, or even to know beforehand all that we need to tell. But an honorable relationship, she reminds us, is one in which we are trying, all the time, to extend the possibilities of truth between us, of life between us"

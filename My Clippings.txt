But you should not ignore the fact that this was a dramatic turn of thought. The highest degree of reality, in Plato’s theory, was that which we think with our reason. It was equally apparent to Aristotle that the highest degree of reality is that which we perceive with our senses. Plato thought that all the things we see in the natural world were purely reflections of things that existed in the higher reality of the world of ideas—and thereby in the human soul. Aristotle thought the opposite: things that are in the human soul were purely reflections of natural objects. So nature is the real world. According to Aristotle, Plato was trapped in a mythical world picture in which the human imagination was confused with the real world.

Aristotle held that all our thoughts and ideas have come into our consciousness through what we have heard and seen. But we also have an innate power of reason. We have no innate ideas, as Plato held, but we have the innate faculty of organizing all sensory impressions into categories and classes. This is how concepts such as “stone,” “plant,” “animal,” and “human” arise. Similarly there arise concepts like “horse,” “lobster,” and “canary.” Aristotle did not deny that humans have innate reason.

So man has no innate “ideas.”

A horse, a motorcycle, better still an automobile, was a more dignifed proposition and preserved greater social distance between colonizer and colonized.

In this respect, the initiative is one among a larger group of projects that act simply as crisis responses to the faltering of state services.

Under Occupy, many general assemblies devolved into similar situations in which even the most mundane of issues had to be painstakingly addressed by a collective.36 The acrimonious debates over drummers making too much noise in the Zuccotti Park occupation are just one particularly farcical example of this.

prefigurative spaces are often subject to state and corporate repression – and if they are not, it is typically because they pose no threat to the existing social order. The Zapatistas, for example, are permitted to exist in relative freedom simply because the state and capital do not see them as a threat.

The Zapatistas, for example, are permitted to exist in relative freedom simply because the state and capital do not see them as a threat.53 The moment a prefigurative space becomes a threat is the moment when repression weighs down on it, and when its fetishisation of horizontalism becomes a serious liability.

The Spanish town of Marinaleda offers a useful example of this. Over the course of three decades, this small community (pop. 2,700) has built up a ‘communist utopia’ that has expropriated land, built its own housing and co-operatives, kept living costs low, and provided work for everyone. Yet the limits of such an approach for transforming capitalism are quickly revealed: housing materials are provided by the regional government, agricultural subsidies come from the European Union, jobs are sustained by the rejection of labour-saving devices, income still comes from selling goods on wider capitalist markets, and businesses remain subjected to capitalist competition and the global financial crisis.103 Marinaleda is but one example of how the project

That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable.’

A primary aim of a postcapitalist world would therefore be to maximise synthetic freedom, or in other words, to enable the flourishing of all of humanity and the expansion of our collective horizons.53 Achieving this involves at least three different elements: the provision of the basic necessities of life, the expansion of social resources, and the development of technological capacities.

One of the Baroque period’s favorite sayings was the Latin expression ‘carpe diem’—‘seize the day.’ Another Latin expression that was widely quoted was ‘memento mori,’ which means ‘Remember that you must die.’ In art, a painting could depict an extremely luxurious lifestyle, with a little skull painted in one corner.

The Baroque period was also an age of conflict in a political sense. Europe was ravaged by wars. The worst was the Thirty Years’ War which raged over most of the continent from 1618 to 1648. In reality it was a series of wars which took a particular toll on Germany. Not least as a result of the Thirty Years’ War, France gradually became the dominant power in Europe.”

Calderon had borrowed it from the old Arabian tales, A Thousand and One Nights. Comparing life to a dream, though, is a theme we find even farther back in history, not least in India and China.

According to Descartes, the human body is a perfect machine. But man also has a mind which can operate quite independently of the body. The bodily processes do not have the same freedom, they obey their own laws. But what we think with our reason does not happen in the body—it happens in the mind, which is completely independent of extended reality.

In fact, unemployment as we understand it today was an invention of capitalism.9 Having been torn away from their means of subsistence, for the first time in history a new ‘surplus population’ emerges that is unable to find waged work.10 While capitalism may exploit the employed working class, as Joan Robinson once wrote, ‘The misery of being exploited by capitalists is nothing compared to the misery of not being exploited at all.’

The primary cause behind this expansion of slums has been primitive accumulation. Spurred on, first by colonialism and then by structural adjustment policies, the peasantry in many developing countries has been forced off their lands via global competition, rapid industrialisation and rampaging climate change. Like the earlier European experience of industrialisation, dispossessed rural workers have migrated to urban areas to find jobs.

In a classic statement, Paul Lafargue argued for limiting work to just three hours a day.63 Keynes famously argued for the same outcome, calculating that by 2030 we would all be working fifteen-hour working weeks – though it is less well known that he was simply verbalising what were the broadly held beliefs of the time.64 And Marx made the shortening of the working week central to his entire postcapitalist vision, arguing that it represented a ‘basic prerequisite’ to reaching ‘the realm of freedom’.

Whether for a religious or secular goal, suffering is thought to constitute a necessary rite of passage. People must endure through work before they can receive wages, they must prove their worthiness before the eyes of capital. This thinking has an obvious theological basis – where suffering is thought to be not only meaningful, but in fact the very condition of meaning. A life without suffering is seen as frivolous and meaningless. This position must be rejected as a holdover from a now-transcended stage of human history.

The physical infrastructures of our world exert a significant hegemonic force upon societies – imposing a way of life without overt coercion. For instance, with regard to urban infrastructure, David Harvey writes that ‘projects concerning what we want our cities to be are … projects concerning human possibilities, who we want, or perhaps even more pertinently, who we do not want to become’.

If Washington had determined that support to the Taliban came from the top rather than from a few rogues, the United States would have had to take Musharraf to task, and neither Bush nor Cheney was prepared to do that. The most U.S. and European intelligence officials in Islamabad would admit was that Pakistani support to the Taliban was being carried out by a few out-of-control ISI officers.

“God is not a puppeteer who pulls all the strings, controlling everything that happens. A real puppet master controls the puppets from outside and is therefore the ‘outer cause’ of the puppet’s movements. But that is not the way God controls the world. God controls the world through natural laws. So God—or nature—is the ‘inner cause’ of everything that happens. This means that everything in the material world happens through necessity. Spinoza had a determinist view of the material, or natural, world.”

“Spinoza emphasizes that there is only one being which is totally and utterly ‘its own cause’ and can act with complete freedom. Only God or nature is the expression of such a free and ‘nonaccidental’ process. Man can strive for freedom in order to live without outer constraint, but he will never achieve ‘free will.’ We do not control everything that happens in our body—which is a mode of the attribute of extension. Neither do we ‘choose’ our thinking. Man therefore does not have a ‘free soul’; it is more or less imprisoned in a mechanical body.”

Subsequently, several books have expanded the cultural contexts for examination of code. David M. Berry’s The Philosophy of Software (2011) takes up a formal consideration of the ontology and epistemology of code, as does Adrian Mackenzie’s Cutting Code (2006). Bradley Dilger and Jeff Rice have collected reflections that center on HTML tokens in A to <A> (2010). As I’ve mentioned, Speaking Code (2012) by Geoff Cox and Alex McLean offers an exploration of the way code acts as speech in the form of a duet, with text by Cox intertwined with code passages by McLean. D. Fox Harrell’s Phantasmal Media (2013) offers programming as a potentially disruptive culturally situated practice. James Brown Jr. applies rhetorical theory to code in Ethical Programs: Hospitality and the Rhetorics of Software (2015). In Coding Literacy: How Computer Programming Is Changing Writing (2017), Annette Vee analyzes code from a legal perspective and examines what the framework of literacy brings to larger conversations about teaching code in cultures. Finally, the most recent work, Kevin Brock’s Rhetorical Code Studies (2019), offers a specific application of critical code studies that reads code as a means of rhetorical discourse

There are quite a few texts that take up the ontology of code. Chun’s Programmed Visions (2011) and Hayles’s My Mother Was a Computer (2005) offer important interventions that situate computation and our fascination with it. Gabriella Coleman’s Coding Freedom (2012) takes up the ethos of the culture of open-source programming. Jussi Parikka’s Digital Contagions (2007), although containing very little code, offers a robust media archaeology of viruses and worms. Because of their philosophical interventions into the study of technoculture, these works provide a foundation for readings of code.

What I loved about loving a performer was believing they never truly performed in front of me. I believed in two intertwined but separate Blakes: Blake Dayes the musician conflicted with the authentic Blake I loved. The Blake I loved offstage was goofy and weepy, prone to puns, sensitive to fluorescent lighting, a fan of obstacle-based game shows, an eager and talentless cook, an unglum lover. A human. And around him, I freed my true self: giggly and gullible, a lounger, insecure, a late sleeper who woke to bedsheets wet by sweat, ticklish, cold-toed, an unintentional killer of plants, pessimistic, exhausted, alone. What a pleasure to know someone so secretly. I assumed he felt the same way about me.

Certain drugs may be able to enhance or encourage the biological responses characteristic of love, while others—sometimes called “chemical breakup” drugs—may be able to lessen or prevent these responses. This isn’t wild science fiction; it is already a realistic possibility. For example, testosterone, oxytocin, and vasopressin are being discussed as drugs that might increase the likelihood of love occurring or continuing,9 while antagonists for oxytocin, vasopressin, or dopamine are being considered as ways of reducing that likelihood.10

But by the mid-1990s, the faster processing speeds of computers and the increased size of computer memory made it practical to offer another technique on desktop workstations—spline-based modeling. This new technique for representing form pushed architectural thinking away from rectangular modernist geometry and toward the privileging of smooth and complex forms made from continuous curves. As a result, since the second part of the 1990s, the aesthetics of “blobs” has come to dominate the thinking of many architecture students, young architects, and even already well-established “star” architects such as Zaha Hadid, Eric Moss, and UN Studio.

Romantic love, as de Beauvoir sees it, is damaging and dangerous to both women and men. It encourages women to seek their own annihilation through absorption into a man’s life and identity—otherwise, they risk being seen as unwomanly. But this is devastating to all the things that de Beauvoir, as an existentialist, considers necessary for an “authentic” life, in particular the freedom to choose one’s own path. Moreover, women in romantic love are taught to see their male partners as impossibly idealized, since otherwise their own annihilation would be too obviously irrational. But no man is impossibly ideal. The inevitable failure to live up to the prescribed manly role in patriarchal romantic love thus ultimately makes love deeply damaging for men as well.

Social constraints can be powerful, but love’s biology is powerful too. No amount of determination to construct a social role for love that excluded queer people managed to shut down the biological machinery of queer love. Over time, the biology won out: the social role expanded to become a better fit for love’s biological reality.

Love’s social role is to take adult attraction and affection and output something resembling a stable nuclear family unit. Where there is resistance to the formation of family-like bonds between queer people or between people racialized into different groups, there is a corresponding resistance to the idea of romantic love between such people. This can take the form of mere disapproval, but even more powerfully, it can take the form of denials that such love is so much as possible. This then leads to the conclusion that any queer or interracial relationship must really be a matter of sexual attraction alone. Because of negative attitudes toward sex in general, this incurs disapproval and disrespect. The desired—and likely—consequence is that, under such pressure and without the normal social supports, the relationship will be unable to fulfill the social function of creating a stable family unit. In terms of Beall and Sternberg’s social constructionism (explored back in chapter 2), we can identify this as one of society’s regulative mechanisms for stamping out disfavored manifestations of love.

Gendered assumptions about how a romantic relationship is supposed to look can have a significant impact on our lives even if we don’t notice it. One fascinating study by psychologists Laurie Rudman and Jessica Heppen found that women who thought of their romantic partners in terms of “chivalry and heroism” (i.e., as knights in shining armor) were on average less interested in pursuing high-status occupations for themselves and less ambitious when it came to earnings, education, and leadership goals.

As she saw it, advances in civilization were destroying the biological basis for that power imbalance, so it had become necessary to shore it up with social institutions. Firestone thought romantic love was one such institution, along with the patriarchal nuclear family. For this reason, she called romanticism “a cultural tool of male power to keep women from knowing their condition.”

In addition to the general instability associated with change of any kind, love has a special place in defining who we think we are and how we think we should live. Expanding the social role of romantic love to include interracial relationships is highly destabilizing to a social order that is rigidly segregated on racial lines. The inclusion of same-sex love—and, more generally, challenging established romantic gender roles—is similarly destabilizing to a social order that expects wives to provide domestic labor for husbands who work outside the home.

Interpretation in the humanities sense is more akin to porting a program from one language to another, where a programmer has to make conscious choices about how to represent one system in another and the porting requires a subjective assessment of what is the essence of the program. Yet interpretation in the humanities goes beyond compiling and porting because it asks, “If x represents y, what is being communicated about both systems?” It asks, “How does one realm of meaning inform or affect another?” In other words, interpretation in the humanities sense is neither deciphering nor translating, but instead uses those techniques (and other hermeneutics) to get at meaning beyond the isomorphic systems. Interpretation then is not merely decoding but the production of another kind of knowledge: insight.

Slowly, as time goes by, you start wondering what you are doing. One year, two years, three years, and you are still on the footpath. But people say, have faith, bharosa—something will happen. But slowly you realize, nothing will happen, and you can live the next five years just like the last three years, and everything will be the same. Wake up, work, eat, drink, sleep, and tomorrow it’s the same thing again. ‘So you start fantasizing about returning. You think of the lush green fields, the cool, pure water, the healthy food. You suddenly decide that you were wrong all along; there is money to be made in the village, especially for a man with your experience.

The very first thing the novelist must learn, he wrote, ‘is self-effacement – the first and that always’. This aligns the novelist with the flâneur, who is at once a man of the crowd and an observer of it.20 This is impossible for a woman like Rhys, or the women she invents

The students identified with Sasha’s plight, just as I once did, on the basis of their own unhappiness, native to the twenty-year-old who has not yet learned to ask for what she wants, or may hardly know it herself. Twenty-year-olds – the kind who wander the streets of Paris looking for meaning – are hungry for experience, but they haven’t yet learned self-protection. They run headlong into despair, just to know how it feels, maybe to find out how strong they are.

But what are these truths of readers? For me these are the living truths of the text, those truths that the text brings to life for us, those truths that connect, in some authentic and memorable way, with our lives. We read texts, as Robert Scholes notes, in the light of what we have lived (Protocols 10). To this I would add, on the ﬂip side, that we live in the light of the texts we have read. Te texts that mater to us become what we might call “life-texts,” not merely texts that come to life for us in reading, but texts that enrich and complicate our lives. Such texts yield something of value for us because of what we bring to them and because of what we take from them. Te truth of the text, thus, for readers, involves the ways we link the text with our lives, the ways we experience the intertextual web of literature, life, and language

In choosing to write essays, a writer exhibits an interest in being factual rather than fctional. Te choice of fact over fction testifes to the writer’s concern for expressing an idea. Even when essayists rely heavily on narrative to convey feelings and atitudes, as Orwell does in “Shooting an Elephant,” their emphasis ultimately rests upon an idea.

The current imperial family traces its hereditary line back to the early sixth century. It emerged as the Yamato family of chief priests and priestesses presiding over one of several clans contending for political supremacy (eight early monarchs were women). By the early 700s, this Yamato clan had achieved unchallenged political as well as sacred authority. It built a capital city and commissioned the writing of historical chronicles that invented a mythic genealogical line extending back from the sixth century c.e. through twenty-eight legendary rulers to 660 b.c.e. This ancient mythology was revived in the late nineteenth century as the orthodox “modern” view of imperial history

Varda has explained that the emotional thrust of the film is about Cléo’s journey from image to subject, the pivot from being ‘the object of the look’ to ‘the subject who looks’. The looks she receives at the beginning of the film shore her up, makes her feel beautiful, desirable, but she finds another kind of validation from within through an afternoon spent wandering in the city. Seeing the familiar sights of her neighbourhood with this new awareness of death and the impending decay of her beauty, Cléo sheds her synthetic self and finally reaches a state of calm self-awareness. The city refuses to let her wallow. It forces her gaze outward.

Perec calls this ‘putting a mawkish face on necessity, a way of dressing up commercialism’, but then he never moved to a foreign country.4 It’s not mawkish when it’s a question of survival; you have to construct a community out of something. It’s when people make a gesture that goes beyond necessity that it becomes neighbourly, like the time the woman who lives downstairs came to my door with an uncooked quiche in her hands, asking to use my oven (hers had broken), which is maybe an urban French version of asking for a cup of sugar.

Flâneuse [flanne-euhze], noun, from the French. Feminine form of flâneur [flanne-euhr], an idler, a dawdling observer, usually found in cities. That is an imaginary definition. Most French dictionaries don’t even include the word. The 1905 Littré does make an allowance for ‘flâneur, -euse’. Qui flâne. But the Dictionnaire Vivant de la Langue Française defines it, believe it or not, as a kind of lounge chair. Is that some kind of joke? The only kind of curious idling a woman does is lying down? This usage (slang of course) began around 1840 and peaked in the 1920s, but continues today: search for ‘flâneuse’ on Google Images and the word brings up a drawing of George Sand, a picture of a young woman sitting on a Parisian bench and a few images of outdoor furniture. * * *

Clear examples of applications-frst and principles-frst reasoning styles can also be found in the legal systems of diferent societies. The British and American systems are based on common law, in which a judgment in one case sets a precedent for future cases—a clear example of applications-frst thinking. By contrast, most European Union states use the civil law system that originated in Roman law and the Napoleonic Code, in which a general statute or principle is applied on a case-by-case basis, mirroring the principles-frst approach.

Chinese people think from macro to micro, whereas Western people think from micro to macro. For example, when writing an address, the Chinese write in sequence of province, city, district, block, gate number. The Westerners do just the opposite—they start with the number of a single house and gradually work their way up to the city and state. In the same way, Chinese put the surname frst, whereas the Westerners do it the other way around. And Chinese put the year before month and date. Again, it’s the opposite in the West.

In a large majority of countries, being egalitarian correlates with valuing consensus. The United States breaks the mold by combining an egalitarian ethos with a more top-down approach to decision making, in which one person—generally the person in charge—makes decisions quickly on behalf of the entire group. Therefore, the United States is more top-down than hierarchical

Recognizing a shared experience helps us stop pathologizing ourselves. Instead of maintaining a narrow and singular focus on the question, “What’s wrong with me?”, we can begin to ask other questions, like “Who says?”, “What group of people has created this reality for us?”, “How does it serve them?”, “What would be different if we stopped believing it?

The relationship with the same-sex parent is, of course, particularly pivotal for the development of authenticity and self-regard. As her mother’s apprentice, a daughter watches to see what it means to be a wife, a mother, and an adult woman. A daughter is sensitively attuned to the quality of her mother’s life and to how her mother conducts her key relationships, including those with her own family of origin. When a daughter senses her mother’s unhappiness or sees through her lies and silence, she may volunteer to fill up her mother’s empty bucket, fix her depression, live out her thwarted dreams, or wave her mother’s banner at the expense of having a relationship with Dad. It is not simply that parents assign their children to a particular role, like “the happy one” or “Mom’s best friend. ” A child may volunteer for such an impossible job in the family without even being asked.

When I first met Bea, she was too angry and intense to broach an emotionally loaded subject with Ruth. Intensity breeds more intensity, only adding to the anxious emotional climate that blocked truth-telling to begin with. Moves toward truth-telling may require us to maintain a calm, emotional presence in an anxious emotional field.Paradoxically, this translates into being “less real” in order to help create an emotional climate in which people can be “more real. ” That is, if “being real” is defined as doing what comes naturally, which in Bea’s case meant angrily avoiding or confronting Ruth. This kind of “realness” or “truth-telling” invariably shuts the lines of communication down even further.

Why bother?” That was my response to a friend many years ago who challenged me to open up an emotion-laden issue in my own family—slowly, responsibly, and with care, and with a plan to manage the inevitable resistance evoked by change.Interestingly, it was no bother to me to try steadily yet clumsily to be in conversation with women halfway around the world.Today, my response would be, instead, “Why not bother?” There is, perhaps, no more direct route to discovering our own truths than to unearth the stories in our immediate and extended family. The stories of our family members are our stories, these stories “are us,” and it is in the exchanging and refining of personal experiences that we can come to know our own truths.

Contrary to what the dictionary tells us, pretending is potentially the most serious form of deception because it can involve living a lie, rather than telling one. And we are least likely to catch ourselves in the act. When we tell an outright lie, we feel jolted. But pretending is imperceptibly woven into the fabric of daily life and so leads to the construction of a false self. We may not feel any jolts along the way, because we are, after all, “just pretending. ” In time, we don’t notice ourselves doing it at all.

The elder god did wear a crucifix. It was regarded in the house as an exotic and desirable charm.

Sushila’s position in the family was unique. She was a widowed daughter whose only child had died. Because of her suffering she was respected, but though she gave herself the airs of authority her status was undefined, at times appearing as high as Mrs Tulsi’s, at times lower than Miss Blackie’s.

Living in a wife-beating society, he couldn’t understand why women were even allowed to nag or how nagging could have any effect. He saw that there were exceptional women, Mrs Tulsi and Tara, for example, who could never be beaten. But most of the women he knew were like Sushila, the widowed Tulsi daughter. She talked with pride of the beatings she had received from her short-lived husband. She regarded them as a necessary part of her training and often attributed the decay of Hindu society in Trinidad to the rise of the timorous, weak, non-beating class of husband.

It would be three weeks before Shama returned to The Chase. He put up a hammock for the baby in the gallery and waited. The shop and the back rooms became increasingly disordered, and felt cold, like an abandoned camp. Yet as soon as Shama came with Lakshmi – ‘Her name is Savi,’ Shama insisted, and Savi it remained – those rooms again became the place where he not only lived, but had status without having to assert his rights or explain his worth.

And though he had spoken humorously, this led to another serious quarrel, which went over the same limited ground until, unable to control his rage, he hit her. They were both astonished. She was silenced in the middle of a sentence; for some time afterwards the unfinished sentence remained in his mind, as though it had just been spoken. She was stronger than he. Her silence and her refusal to retaliate made his humiliation complete. She dressed Anand and went to Arwacas.

Mr Biswas didn’t know that Savi had begun to go to school. Shama sat on a bench, held Savi between her legs, combed her hair, plaited it, straightened the pleats on her navy-blue uniform, and adjusted her Panama hat. Mother and daughter had been doing this for many weeks. And he had known nothing.

At The Chase Shama had seldom beat Savi, and then it had been only a matter of a few slaps. But at Hanuman House the sisters still talked with pride of the floggings they had received from Mrs Tulsi. Certain memorable floggings were continually recalled, with commonplace detail made awful and legendary by its association with a stupendous event, like the detail in a murder case. And there was even some rivalry among the sisters as to who had been flogged worst of all.

Pogrebin also draws a connection between secrecy and power: “While men control the history of nations and civilizations, women use family history as their negotiable instruments. And if knowledge is power, clandestine knowledge is power squared; it can be withheld, exchanged and leveraged.

However, it is not being suggested that African agriculture in the early period was superior lo that of other continents. On the contrary, African standards of husbandry on the land and with livestock were not as high as those independently evolved in most parts of Asia and Europe. The weakness in Africa seemed to have been the lack of a professional interest in acquiring more scientific knowledge and in devising tools to lighten the load of labour as well as to transform hostile environments into areas suitable for human activity. As far as agriculture in Europe was concerned, this professionalism was undertaken by the class with a vested interest in the land — namely, the feudalist landowners and later the capitalist farmers

Now it didn’t matter when I worked on my projects. They were energizing and rarely left me drained. For a long time, I had thought that if I wanted to be happier with my work, I just needed a better job. Now I saw that I just wanted a different relationship with work, one that, at least for now, didn’t come with a paycheck.

Installation often overlaps with other post - 1960 genres, such as fuxus, land art, minimalism, video art, performance, conceptual art, and process, all of which share an interest in issues such as site specifcity, participation, institutional critique, temporality, and ephemerality. Installation artworks are participatory sculptural environments in which the viewer’s spatial and temporal experience with the exhibition space and the various objects within it forms part of the work itself.8 These pieces are meant to be experienced as activated spaces rather than as discrete objects: they are designed to “unfold” during the spectator’s experience in time rather than to be known visually all at once. Installations made with media screens are especially evocative in that as environmental, experiential sculptures, they stage temporal and spatialized encounters between viewing subjects and technological objects, between bodies and screens. A potentially new mode of screen - reliant spectatorship emerges in the process.

Slavery is useful for early accumulation of capital, but it is too rigid for industrial development. Slaves had to be given crude non-breakable tools which held back the capitalist development of agriculture and industry. That explains the fact that the northern portions of the U.S.A. gained far more industrial benefits from slavery than the South which actually had slave institutions on its soil; and ultimately the stage was reached during the American Civil War when the Northern capitalists fought to end slavery within the boundaries of the U.S.A., so that the country as a whole could advance to a higher level of capitalism

Indeed, it would have been impossible to open up the New World and to use it as a constant generator of wealth, had it not been for African labour. There were no other alternatives: the American (Indian) population was virtually wiped out and Europe’s population was too small for settlement overseas at that time. Then, having become utterly dependent on African labour, Europeans at home and abroad found it necessary to rationalise that exploitation in racist terms as well. Oppression follows logically from exploitation, so as to guarantee the latter. Oppression of African people on purely racial grounds accompanied, strengthened and became indistinguishable from oppression for economic reasons

There was always a contradiction between the elaboration of democratic ideas inside Europe and the elaboration of authoritarian and thuggish practices by Europeans with respect to Africans. When the French Revolution was made in the name of ‘Liberty, Equality and Fraternity’, it did not extend to black Africans who were enslaved by France in the West Indies and the Indian Ocean. Indeed, France fought against the efforts of those people to emancipate themselves, and the leaders of their bourgeois revolution said plainly that they did not make it on behalf of black humanity

Our isolation isn’t just a geographic accident; it was practically a mission statement when America was founded.

The Belgian town of Baarle-Hertog is even more intriguing: it’s made up of no fewer than twenty-six separate pieces of Belgium sitting, thanks to a complicated series of medieval treaties between two warring dukes, in the middle of the Netherlands. Some of these little bits of Belgium have little bits of the Netherlands inside them, leading to an impossibly intricate border that divides some village homes in half between the two nations. Your nationality depends on where your front door is, and residents have been known to “emigrate” by moving their door every time the tax laws change. When bars and restaurants in the Netherlands close, landlords just move their tables onto the Belgian side of their establishment and keep on serving.

It is, in essence, indefinable, but slipstream induces a sense of 'otherness' in the audience, like a glimpse into a distorting mirror, perhaps, or a view of familiar sights and objects from an unfamiliar perspective. In general it imparts a sense that reality might not be quite as certain as we think. It is therefore possible to find elements of slipstream outside literature: in music, films, graphic novels, installation art and so on.

The geopolitical equivalent of the space race at that time was a “spice race” for Asian cinnamon, pepper, and nutmeg, and Vasco da Gama had just given Portugal a crucial edge by charting a sea route to India.

My immediate assumption is that the root of the achievement gap is spatial ability. Tests on gender and navigation have found that women tend to navigate via landmarks (“I turn left when I get to the gas station”) whereas men use dead reckoning (“I still need to be north and maybe a little west of here”), which ties in nicely with the evolutionary perspective: early men went out on hunting expeditions in all directions and always needed to be good at finding their way back to the cave, developing their “kinesic memory,” while women foraged for edibles closer to home, developing “object location memory.” Simply put, men got better at finding places, while women got better at finding things.

Why would so many people trade some of their newfound freedom to join these authoritarian movements? Fromm argued that the reason lied behind two different types of freedom. First was negative freedom or “freedom from” outside control. Second was positive freedom or the “freedom to” engage with the world in a way that is true to yourself.” Fromm’s positive version of freedom was much more than the freedom to act. He described it as “the full realization of the individual’s potential, together with his ability to live actively and spontaneously.” Fromm argued that those freed from oppression but unable to develop a positive version of freedom were destined to be filled with feelings of separateness and anxiety.154

He argues, “the secret of the world is that it is a very malleable place, we must be sure that people learn this, and never forget the order: Learning is naturally the consequence of doing.”

Until the 1600s when clocks became ubiquitous, people rarely thought about time. English historian E.P. Thompson noted that instead, people thought in terms of activities. In Madagascar, a half-hour was a “rice cooking,” and a brief moment was “frying a locust.” When they had clocks, people increasingly thought about time as something related to money. Thompson noted that “time is now currency, it is not passed but spent.”

A peasant growing a cash crop or collecting produce had his labour exploited by a long chain of individuals, starting with local businessmen. Sometimes, those local businessmen were Europeans. Very rarely were they Africans, and more usually they were a minority group brought in from outside and serving as intermediaries between the white colonialists and the exploited African peasant. In West Africa, the Lebanese and Syrians played this role; while in East Africa the Indians rose to this position. Arabs were also in the middleman category in Zanzibar and a few other places on the East African coast.

The African peasant went in for cash-crop farming for many reasons. A minority eagerly took up the opportunity to continue to acquire European goods, which they had become accustomed to during the pre-colonial period. Many others in every section of the continent took to earning cash because they had to pay various taxes in money or because they were forced to work.

In some areas, such as West Africa, Africans had become so attached to European manufactures during the early period of trade that, on their own initiative, they were prepared to go to great lengths to participate in the colonial money economy. But that was not the universal response. In many instances, Africans did not consider the monetary incentives great enough to justify changing their way of life so as to become labourers or cash-crop farmers. In such cases, the colonial state intervened to use law, taxation and outright force to make Africans pursue a line favourable to capitalist profits

As John Stuart Mill said, the trade between England and the West Indies in the 18th century was like the trade between town and country. In the present century, the links are even closer and it is more marked that the town (Europe) is living off the countryside (Africa, Asia and Latin America). When it said that colonies should exist for the metropoles by producing raw materials and buying manufactured goods, the underlying theory was to introduce an international division of labour covering working people everywhere. That is to say, up to that point, each society had allocated to its own members particular functions in production-some hunted, some made clothes, some built houses, etc. But with colonialism, the capitalists determined what types of labour the workers should carry on in the world at large. Africans were to dig minerals out of the sub-soil, grow agricultural crops, collect natural products and perform a number of other odds and ends such as bicycle repairing. Inside of Europe, North America and Japan, workers would refine the minerals and the raw materials and make the bicycles.

Therefore, the vital copper exports from Congo, Northern Rhodesia and other parts of Africa were contributing to the leading sector of European technology. From that strategic position, its multiplier effects were innumerable and were of incalculable benefit to capitalist development.

Colonialism was based on alien political rule and was restricted to some parts of the world. Imperialism, however, underlay all colonies, extended all over the world (except where replaced by Socialist revolutions), and it allowed the participation of all capitalist nations.

The business of marketing and selling to women literally depends on creating and then addressing female insecurity, and part of the revelatory potential of women’s lib involved rejecting the marketplace’s sweet-talking promises about life-changing face creams and shampoos—not to mention the entire premise of women as decorative objects. There was good reason for industries that sustained themselves on the self-hatred of women to dread the potential reach of feminist movements. Co-opting the language of liberation to sell their products allowed them to have it both ways, celebrating the spirit of the movement while fostering a new set of insecurities (“Natural-look” cosmetics, anyone?) and a new aspirational archetype.

The idea that it matters less what you choose than that you have the right to choose is the crux of “choice feminism,” whose rise coincided with the rapid, near-overwhelming expansion of consumer choice that began in the 1980s

Empowertising not only builds on the idea that any choice is a feminist choice if a self-labeled feminist deems it so, but takes it a little bit further to suggest that being female is in itself something that deserves celebration. The ego, already so key to effective advertising, is indispensible to empowertising, with its emphasis on the “personal sell” that takes the focus off objective value and places it firmly within the buyer’s sense of individual mythology. What Douglas pinpointed as liberatory narcissism wears a different guise than it did in the 1980s—one that’s less concerned with status or possessions than with the very state of womanhood.

the Bechdel Test is not a judgment of quality or nuance. After all, the beautiful, moving Gravity fails the test, while a formulaic rom-com like 27 Dresses passes with no problem. But the test itself is a simple, bloodless assessment of whether female characters are deemed important to a story—and a way to conclude that, most of the time, they aren’t.

Nicki Lisa Cole, a scholar who’s currently at work on a book about the worldwide dominance of Apple, notes that branding has become more important as the labor that creates actual products is increasingly outsourced. “Companies used to stand on their product,” she explains. “That was your name, the product that you made. But when you don’t actually make the product, you have to create something else to sell to people.” What becomes valued is the brand.

The feminist uncanny valley is the result of a larger neoliberal framework that over the past five decades has come to unite politics, economics, and culture in a web of individualism, privatization, and decreasing focus on both community and compassion. As a theory, neoliberalism privileges free trade, corporate deregulation, and privatization; as a practice, it took specific hold in the 1980s, when Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher joined forces to enact policies that shifted economic power from the government to the private sector. Neoliberalism holds that we don’t need government because we’ve got the free market, in which we’re all theoretically equal and which will sort out what’s valuable and what’s not. Its social message, meanwhile, is that underclasses—the poor and economically disenfranchised—are not oppressed, but just insufficiently motivated—or, less charitably, unwilling to do the bootstrappulling that’s required to get ahead.

The title “Moving Past Gender Roles to Negotiate a Raise” was misleading, given that the piece was all about what women in the workplace should do differently than men when advocating for better pay. Women were urged, for instance, to take negotiation-playbook tips written for men and “soften” them, given that employers often find it “unseemly, if on an unconscious level” when women talk up their merits. Elsewhere, female-identified workers were advised to approach salary talks as “dialogues,” rather than negotiations, since asking for what they deserve—as men are expected to—would be sure to freak everybody out.

one of the most jarring features of reality TV is the way it urges its female participants—and, often, the women and girls who watch them—toward narrower and narrower definitions of beauty, self-worth, and success, as well as a truncated sense of what kind of life is possible and desirable, all while encouraging them to see other women only in terms of competition and comparison

Reality TV is part of an ongoing narrative of postfeminism that, like Wonderbra billboards once did, assures women that feminism has granted them the power and the freedom to be whatever they want to be.

If only your demands for equality were less strident, then people might really get on board—in fact, do you have to call them demands? There are few activists who haven’t heard some variation on this theme, and though history confirms that social justice just doesn’t work that way, feminism in particular has been prone to internalizing the criticism. Those semi-regular calls to “rebrand” feminism over the decades are based on the idea that feminism has alienated so many people that the only way to get it back on track is with a makeover so hypnotically alluring that people will forget what it is they thought was so distasteful about it in the first place.

Watson] seems to suggest that the reason men aren’t involved in the fight for gender equality is that women simply haven’t invited them and, in fact, have been unwelcoming. Women haven’t given men a formal invitation, so they haven’t joined in. It’s not because, you know, men benefit HUGELY (socially, economically, politically, etc. ad infinitum) from gender inequality, and therefore have much less incentive to support its dismantling. It’s not because of the prevalence of misogyny the entire world over. It’s just that no one’s asked.

There’s a Sisyphean slog through the same sets of arguments, over and over: feminists of color are taxed by having to explain and defend the concept of intersectionality; feminists engaged in sex work are frustrated by others who presume to know their lives better than they do. Within these virtual and actual spaces, such issues feel urgent, and personal, and crucial. But from outside, it can look very much like a movement that’s eating its own.

With a woman, who was too much the same, it never felt that way. So much had to be earned—but no earnings built up! Trust had to be won from zero at every encounter. That’s the reason you always see women being so effusive with each other—crying out shrilly upon recognizing each other in the street. Women always have to confirm with each other, even after so many years: We are still all right. But in the exaggeration of their effusiveness, you know that things are not all right between them, and that they never will be. A woman can’t find rest or take up home in the heart of another woman—not permanently. It’s just not a safe place to land. I knew the heart of a woman could be a landing ground for a man, but for a woman to try to land in another woman’s heart? That would be like landing on something wobbly, without form, like trying to stand tall in Jell-O. Why would I want to stand tall in Jell-O?

Intimacy can’t exist if the participants aren’t willing to make themselves known, to be revealed. But gauging the levels is tricky. Either you don’t communicate enough and remain concealed from other people, or you risk rejection by exposing too much altogether: the minor and major hurts, the tedious obsessions, the abscesses and cataracts of need and shame and longing.

She doesn’t even cover her head in front of you.” “What of it?” said my father-in-law. “I’m the one who has asked her not to. She is like my daughter.” And it was true: he had asked me not to bother covering my head in front of him, only to make sure that it was covered if others were around, because, as he explained, “this is a village and people are not so open-minded.” In fact, people there were curious to see if a city girl like me could manage the housework. Both my father-in-law and mother-inlaw assured them that I could, and my husband’s elder aunt also told them that she thought I was good-natured. Everyone there was kind to me and seemed to like me

This allowed you to type in strings of numbers that could be read as words, if the person you were paging knew that was what you were up to. Instead of a callback number, you’d instead enter 3341 (sa-mi-shi-i)—“I’m lonely.” To which your recipient might reply, 1052167 (do-ko-ni-i-ru-no)—“Where are you?” Your answer, 428 = “Shi-bu-ya.” It was kludgy and indirect; in the earliest iterations of the technology, the numeric code would take the place of the callback number, so it was necessary to discuss things ahead of time for a recipient to know who was messaging.

Unlike creativity, imagination is an appreciative skill with an external locus, rather than an instrumental capacity with an internal locus. To notice a pattern in current events that could serve as a premise for a movie is imagination. To be able to develop that premise into an actual screenplay with compelling characters, fresh dialog and an engrossing plot is creativity. You feed creativity by making things. You feed imagination by being curious about things beyond your own shadow.

When outflow and inflow are in a dynamic balance, harmonizing mask and daemon continuously, in an environment with just enough surplus chaos to occupy surplus freedom and drive the process, you get sustained generativity: the process of manufacturing more freedom than you consume through the act of living.

I don’t think the future will be made in Japan. It will be made everywhere else, with values borrowed from Japan. I can’t take full credit for this insight; it, too, dates back to the nineteenth century, when the term wakon-yosai —“Japanese spirit, Western know-how”—guided the long-isolated nation in its relentless drive to catch up with America and Europe.

Technology is the result of antifragility, exploited by risk-takers in the form of tinkering and trial and error, with nerd-driven design confined to the backstage. Engineers and tinkerers develop things while history books are written by academics; we will have to refine historical interpretations of growth, innovation, and many such things.

For Henry, there was no one to keep track; no agency and no control. The world he inhabited was a place in which things happen to you, abruptly and without warning, where one’s belief in the predictability of the future is severely undermined.
